<h1>Exercise 01: Tripping an Assert</h1>

<p>For this exercise, make sure you run all commands from the directory: 

<pre>
  /path/to/cbat_tools/docs/exercises/01
</pre>

<h2>The sample binary program</h2>

<p>There is a program at <code>binary/main</code>. The source code lives at <a href="binary/main.c">binary/main.c</a>, though you should be able to complete this exercise without looking at the source code.

<p>Imagine that this program is part of the software that runs on a badge reader. The task of this particular program is to check if a number is a valid employee ID.

<ul>
  <li>If the provided number is a valid employee ID, it returns <code>0</code>.</li>
  <li>If the provided number is not a valid employee ID, it returns <code>1</code>.</li>
  <li>There is an assert to ensure the number is within reasonable bounds.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can try it, if you like. Try it with a valid employee ID:

<pre>
    $ ./binary/main 0x39256
    $ echo $?
</pre>

<p>Try it with an invalid employee ID:

<pre>
    $ ./binary/main 0x234
    $ echo $?
</pre>

<h2>Your task</h2>

<p>Use <code>wp</code> to complete the following tasks:

<ol>
  <li>Find out if it is possible to trip the assert in the function <code>is_valid_ID</code>.</li>
  <li>If it is possible to try the assert, use <code>wp</code>'s output to determine an example of an argument that will trip the assert.</li>
  <li>Use <code>bildb</code> to step through the program line-by-line, and replicate the behavior of tripping the assert.</li>
</ol>
