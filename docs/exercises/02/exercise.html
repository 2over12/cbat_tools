<h1>Exercise 02: Solving Sudoku</h1>

<p>For this exercise, make sure you run all commands from the directory: 

<pre>
  /path/to/cbat_tools/docs/exercises/02
</pre>

The task of this exercise is to let <code>wp</code> solve a 3x3 Sudoku cube.


<h2>3x3 Sudoku cubes</h2>

A 3x3 sudoku cube has 9 squares, some of which have a <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, or <code>3</code> in them. For example:

<pre>
+---+---+---+
|   |   | 2 |
+---+---+---+
| 2 |   |   |
+---+---+---+
|   | 2 |   |
+---+---+---+
</pre>

To solve a cube such as this, you must fill in each square with a <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, or <code>3</code>, so that each row and each column in the cube contains one each of <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>.

For example, a correct solution to the above would be this:

<pre>
+---+---+---+
| 3 | 1 | 2 |
+---+---+---+
| 2 | 3 | 1 |
+---+---+---+
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
+---+---+---+
</pre>

Such a solution can be encoded as a 32-bit number. To do that, convert each digit into a 2-bit binary number (so <code>1</code> becomes <code>01</code>, <code>2</code> becomes <code>10</code>, and <code>3</code> becomes <code>11</code>), then concatenate them, and pad with 12 zeros on the right to make the whole number 32 bits wide. 

For example, to encode the above solution as a 32-bit number, do it like this:

<pre>
+---+---+---+      +----+----+----+
| 3 | 1 | 2 |      | 11 | 01 | 10 |    11 01 10
+---+---+---+      +----+----+----+
| 2 | 3 | 1 |  =>  | 10 | 11 | 01 | => 10 11 01
+---+---+---+      +----+----+----+
| 1 | 2 | 3 |      | 01 | 10 | 11 |    01 10 11
+---+---+---+      +----+----+----+


=>  11 01 10   10 11 01   01 10 11    00000000000000

        ^          ^         ^              ^
        |          |         |              |
     1st row    2nd row   3rd row     Pad with zeros


=>  110110 101101 011011 00000000000000
=>  11011010110101101100000000000000 
</pre>

Finally, use a binary-to-hex converter (easily found online) to convert that binary number to a hex value. In this case:

<pre>
11011010110101101100000000000000  =>  0xDAD6C000
</pre>

So <code>0xDAD6C000</code> represents the above solution to the 3x3 cube.

Here is another solution to a 3x3 cube, which is not correct (can you see why it is not correct?):

<pre>
+---+---+---+      +----+----+----+
| 1 | 3 | 2 |      | 01 | 11 | 10 |    01 11 10
+---+---+---+      +----+----+----+
| 2 | 3 | 1 |  =>  | 10 | 11 | 01 | => 10 11 01
+---+---+---+      +----+----+----+
| 3 | 2 | 1 |      | 11 | 10 | 01 |    11 10 01
+---+---+---+      +----+----+----+


=>  01 11 10   10 11 01   11 10 01    00000000000000
=>  01111010110111100100000000000000
=>  0x7ADE4000 (in hex)
</pre>

So, <code>0x7ADE4000</code> is a solution to a 3x3 sudoku cube, but it is a solution which is incorrect.


<h2>The sample binary program</h2>

There is a program at <code>binary/main</code>. The source code lives at <a href="binary/main.c">binary/main.c</a>, but you should be able to complete this exercise without looking at the source code.

This program checks solutions to a 3x3 sudoku cube. The program contains a function <code>check</code>, which takes for its argument a solution encoded as a 32-bit number in the manner described above. This function checks if the provided number represents a correct solution. If so, it trips an assert.

Try it out, using the number we constructed above, namely <code>0x7ADE4000</code>, which represents an incorrect solution:

<pre>
    $ ./binary/main 0x7ADE4000
</pre>

When you run this, the program prints the solution you provided:

<pre>
+---+---+---+
| 1 | 3 | 2 |
+---+---+---+
| 2 | 3 | 1 |
+---+---+---+
| 3 | 2 | 1 |
+---+---+---+
</pre>

Check the exit code:

<pre>
    $ echo $?
</pre>

You will see that the program returned <code>1</code>, to indicate that the solution is not correct.

Now try it with the number we constructed above that represents a correct solution, namely <code>0xDAD6C000</code>:

<pre>
    $ ./binary/main 0xDAD6C000
</pre>

Again, it prints the solution you provided: 

<pre>
+---+---+---+
| 3 | 1 | 2 |
+---+---+---+
| 2 | 3 | 1 |
+---+---+---+
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
+---+---+---+
</pre>

But this time, since the solution is correct, it trips the assert:

<pre>
main: main.c:68: check: Assertion `0' failed.
Aborted
</pre>


<h2>Your task</h2>

Use <code>wp</code> to complete the following task:

<ol>
  <li>Use <code>wp</code> to find a hex number that represents a correct solution to a 3x3 sudoku cube.</li>
  <li>Convert that hex number to a 3x3 sudoku cube board (draw the board, with the correct <code>1</code>s, <code>2</code>s, and <code>3</code>s in it).</li>
</ol>
